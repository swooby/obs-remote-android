# obs-remote-android

This is an updated version of bilhamil's http://www.obsremote.com Android client:
https://github.com/bilhamil/OBSRemote/tree/master/AndroidClientWorkspace

THAT code is an Eclipse Workspace.  
THIS code compiles and runs from Android Studio.

All credit for this app goes to bilhamil, and I have not contacted him yet about my using his code.

I have cleaned up the dependencies and taken the liberty of changing the package name from "com.bilhamil.obsremote" to "com.swooby.obsremote" because:
1) It looks like he has abandoned his repo (no updates since early 2014)
2) To not conflict with anyone running the original app

I have not followed the standard practice of forking bilhamil's repo because:
1) His repo contains other projects that I consider unrelated in 2017
2) My plan w/ this code is only a temporary proof of concept that it will compile and run in Android Studio

I will eventually update my fork of his repo (https://github.com/swooby/OBSRemote) and send him a Pull Request, but I wouldn't expect anyone with a project that has been dead for 4 years to accept it.  
For now I will just leave this code here, w/ the occasional update, for prosperity's sake.

My actual plans are for an entirely new app written from scratch in C#/Mono/Xamarin that will run on both Android and iOS.
